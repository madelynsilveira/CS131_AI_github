Implementation done in python.

Files added to provided implementation:
1. gen_clean.py
    Implementation of general-cleaning related tasks and conditional.
2. spot_clean.py
    Implementation of spot-cleaning related tasks and conditional.
3. nothing.py
    Implementation of DoNothing task.

To run:
Run main.py and provide prompted input.
/usr/bin/python3 ./py_student_1.0.2/main.py

Design:
The AI for this roomba was implemented using a simplified Behavior Tree. 

Reflection:
A few things made me a little uneasy about this assignment. Firstly, I 
implemented my priority composite to completely ignore RUNNING state 
information, as it was described to do. This meant, however, that the roomba 
would theoretically be doing multiple things at once, like cleaning a spot 
while also "Doing nothing", which didn't really make sense to me but I 
figured it was the result of a simplified implementation. 
Second, I was a little unsure of how CleanFloor should be implemented. I made 
it repeat until failure, as shown on the tree, but if it fails when there's 
nothing more to clean, then you won't be done with general cleaning when 
there's nothing more to clean. I think I got a little confused around the 
logistics of the roomba so I tried to follow the code of the tree as closely 
as I could.
